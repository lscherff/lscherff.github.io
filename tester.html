There is a little problem with my faculty development grant: I originally have applied for support for two visits to Penn State. After I’ve visited them once, I was asked to moderate an online discussion, as part of their “Virtual Salon” series. Doing this resulted in a successful email-list-based discussion about art and cognitive/neuroscience (https://sites.psu.edu/neurohumanities/virtual-salons/ ). As this project proved to be very time-consuming, I decided to focus on this task alone and not to physically attend the second “real” salon at Penn State. 
The result is that I’ve spent a total of $708.85 for travel, of which $250 have been covered by Penn State. I have thus needed less money than originally expected and my project changed (as opposed to my grant application) from two visit to State College to one visit and the online-moderation project. Is there a way of properly dealing with this situation?
Best,
Lasse
